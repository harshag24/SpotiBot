# SpotiBot
A voice controlled bot-type app (Without any AI) to control Spotify! It uses Spotify Android SDK to connect to Spotify and Android Studio and Java for the app.
</br>
It currently supports 5 commands - Playback, Pause, Resume, Next and Shuffle. You just have to press the start button for the same.
</br>
I would be replacing the start button feature so that it will keep listening for commands unitl stopped.
